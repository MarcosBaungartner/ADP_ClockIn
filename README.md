ADP eXpert ClockIn Automation
The main purpose of this automation is to record entries and exits in the payroll software ADP eXpert (https://expert.brasil.adp.com/) 
by using the Excel spreadsheet ADP.xlsx which already contains all the times filled from January 1st to December 31th. You can edit these times according to your work schedules.
The path.txt file constains the paths to the chrome driver and to the download directory for the paychecks, which need to be configured before running the Python script.
